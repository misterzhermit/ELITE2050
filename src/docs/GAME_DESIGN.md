- **FOR (Força)**: Physical strength and stamina.
- **AGI (Agilidade)**: Speed and reaction time.
- **INT (Inteligência)**: Tactical awareness and decision making.
- **TAT (Tática)**: Position play and teamwork.
- **TEC (Técnica)**: Ball control and technical skills.

### Fusion Skills
Derived from combinations of Pentagon attributes:
- **DET (Determinação)**: FOR + INT
- **PAS (Passes)**: TAT + TEC
- **DRI (Drible)**: AGI + INT (Line players)

## Progression & Evolution
- **Phase (Form)**: A dynamic value (0-10) reflecting recent performance. High phase boosts rating temporarily.
- **Rating Progression**: After matches, players gain "potential completion" based on their performance and potential ceiling.
